Call for review of multilingual CoreVocs translations – your support needed!


To enable and extend the use of Core Vocabularies by public administrations across Europe, we would like to make them available in multilingual versions.


In a first translation round, the Working Groups had a look at four out of the six Core Vocabularies and translated the labels and descriptions into seven of the 23 official languages of the European Union.


As a next step, our SEMIC experts pre-translated the remaining combinations of Core Vocabularies and language versions by using Google translate. Moreover, we created translations for a more extensive list of properties from the Core Vocabularies. These properties had not been considered during the Working Groups’ first translation round.


Today, we would like to invite you to support us in finalising this ambitious exercise and to review and, if necessary, to correct the translations. If you are interested in bringing your language skills to value and participating in the review, please follow the instructions below.


The call for review of translations is open until Friday 26th of October 2018.


We would like to thank you in advance for your time and commitment!


Best regards,
The SEMIC team
